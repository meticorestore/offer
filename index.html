                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">Fitness is not limited to workouts. In fact, your workout is just the beginning. Proper nutrition and supplementation are key components for a well-rounded fitness plan.
<div>
</div><div>This article not only provides healthy nutritional alternatives, but tips on which foods are best before and after a workout.
</div><div>
</div><div>Before your workout, your body needs calories. Not just any old calories, not empty calories, but calories that will fuel your workout with energy. After your workout, your muscles need replenishment, so it’s just as important to eat not long after exercise.
</div><div>
</div><div>The following recipes contain essential nutrients: Protein, fat, and carbohydrates. They are not only delicious and nutritious, these recipes will help you burn fat and gain lean mass. Not to mention, they are filling, easy, and don’t require a lot or prep time.
</div><div>
</div><div>1. 15-Minute Tex-Mex Chicken Salad
</div><div>
</div><div>Got 15 minutes? This is a great post-workout meal. It contains Omega-3 oil, protein, potassium, carbohydrates and a host of other nutrients to help replenish those lost during exercise. This Tex-Mex Chicken Salad is courtesy of Registered Dietician Matthew Kadey.
</div><div>
</div><div>Check out the recipe here: 15-Minute Tex-Mex Chicken Salad, Muscle &amp; Fitness
</div><div>
</div><div>2. Chocolate Chia Recovery Drink
</div><div>
</div><div>Think about it. Our bodies lose a lot of water during exercise, leaving us dehydrated. And what’s one of the natural supplements to replace lost electrolytes? Coconut water.
</div><div>
</div><div>After a spin class, Crossfit, or HIIT, a Chocolate Chia Recovery Drink is perfect. Chia seeds are full of “good” carbs, mostly fiber, which means your body digests them slowly, keeping your hunger at bay. Bananas contain potassium which helps to curtail muscle cramps. Just blend and go!
</div><div>
</div><div>Here’s the recipe from the “Minimalist Baker:” Chocolate Chia Recovery Drink
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Blueberry-Almond Overnight Oats
</div><div>
</div><div>Let’s face it, getting to the gym is hard enough. Who has time to muster up all kinds of ingredients, cook, and consume? Prepare Blueberry-Almond Overnight Oats. Full of fiber, protein and complex carbohydrates, this filling meal awaits you in the morning.
</div><div>
</div><div>The antioxidants in the blueberries will help kick up and spit out free radicals that exists in the body, making way for smooth cellular activity. Prep time: Five minutes!
</div><div>
</div><div>Here you go: Blueberry-Almond Overnight Oats
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Asian Jalapeno Chicken

</div><div>
</div><div>This recipe calls for all-purpose flour, a refined carbohydrate, and sugar, both of which have a high glycemic index, causing your blood sugar to spike.

</div><div>
</div><div>Final Words
</div><div>It is important to consume the aforementioned nutrient-based meals 45 minutes to an hour, both before and after your workout. If not, your body will use muscle for fuel instead of nutrients and, ultimately, you will lose lean muscle mass and become flabby.</div></h4>
